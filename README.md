trends to change everyday based on the number of games won/lost.

Project Rationale
Player performance: Analyze the statistics of individual players to identify the top
performers in various categories, such as points per game, assists per game, rebounds per
game, etc. This could help identify valuable players for fantasy basketball teams or for
evaluating potential trades.
Team performance: Analyze team statistics to identify which teams are performing well
overall, as well as which teams excel in specific areas such as defense or scoring. This could
help you make predictions about which teams will perform well in the playoffs or in future
seasons.
Player development: By analyzing player statistics over time, we can identify which players
are improving or declining in performance. This could help teams make decisions about
which players to invest in, as well as help fans and analysts understand the trajectory of a
player's career.
Trends and patterns: Analyze the data to identify trends and patterns in player or team
performance over time, such as changes in playing style or the impact of rule changes. This
could help you make predictions about future performance or identify areas for further
research.

This project demonstrates the team’s skills in the following topics:
• Real-world data fields are arranged into an ER diagram.
• Establishing and populating a SQL database with DDL and DML commands.
• Finding significant trends and patterns from the SQL queries.
